Title: Package About Data Manipulation in Pure Base R
Description: A lightweight, dependency-free data engine for R that provides 
    a grammar for tabular and time-series manipulation. Built entirely on 
    Base R, 'm61r' offers a fluent, composable API inspired by modern data 
    tools while prioritizing memory efficiency and speed. It includes 
    optimized versions of common data verbs such as filtering, mutation, 
    grouped aggregation, and approximate temporal joins, making it an 
    ideal choice for environments where external dependencies are 
    restricted or where performance in pure R is required.
Depends:
    R (>= 4.2.0)
